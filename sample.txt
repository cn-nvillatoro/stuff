In order for Mergify to apply your rules to your pull requests,
you need to create a configuration file.
The configuration file should be created in the root directory of each enabled repository and named .mergify.yml.
The configuration file format is entirely documented in Configuration File Format.

Since this file does not contain any specific rules, Mergify won’t do anything.
So let’s create a rule to make it useful!

The name of the rule is not used directly by Mergify,
but is really useful when Mergify will report its status and for debugging rules.
We advise setting an explicity name that makes sense to you.

Third time's a charm! or so we thought!

So maybe 3rd try is not a  charm.

Why not 4th?

Or 5th?

This should not have a conflict.
